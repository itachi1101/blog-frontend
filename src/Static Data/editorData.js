        title: "FIFA WORLD CUP",
        description: "The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The tournament has been held every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. The reigning champions are France, who won their second title at the 2018 tournament in Russia.\r\n\r\nThe format involves a qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 32 teams compete for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over about a month. The host nation(s) automatically qualify.\r\n\r\nAs of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 21 final tournaments have been held and a total of 79 national teams have competed. The trophy has been won by eight national teams. Brazil, with five wins, are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are Germany and Italy, with four titles each; Argentina, France, as well as inaugural winner Uruguay, with two titles each; and England and Spain, with one title each.\r\n\r\nThe World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and followed single sporting event in the world. The cumulative viewership of all matches of the 2006 World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the final match, a ninth of the entire population of the planet.[1][2][3][4]\r\n\r\nSeventeen countries have hosted the World Cup. Brazil, France, Italy, Germany and Mexico have each hosted twice, while Uruguay, Switzerland, Sweden, Chile, England, Argentina, Spain, the United States, Japan and South Korea (the latter two jointly), South Africa and Russia have each hosted once. Qatar is hosting the 2022 tournament; in 2026 it will be jointly hosted by Canada, the United States and Mexico, which will give Mexico the distinction of being the first country to host games in three World Cups.",

        title: "What is MERN stack",
        description: "MERN is one of several variations of the MEAN stack (MongoDB Express Angular Node), where the traditional Angular.js front-end framework is replaced with React.js. Other variants include MEVN (MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node), and really any front-end JavaScript framework can work.\r\nWhat is the MERN stack?\r\nMERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.\r\n\r\nMongoDB — document database\r\nExpress(.js) — Node.js web framework\r\nReact(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework\r\nNode(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server\r\n\r\n\r\nExpress and Node make up the middle (application) tier. Express.js is a server-side web framework, and Node.js is the popular and powerful JavaScript server platform. Regardless of which variant you choose, ME(RVA)N is the ideal approach to working with JavaScript and JSON, all the way through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does the MERN stack work?\r\nThe MERN architecture allows you to easily construct a three-tier architecture (front end, back end, database) entirely using JavaScript and JSON.\r\n\r\n",
